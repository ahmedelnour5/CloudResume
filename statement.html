      <h2>Statement of Interdisciplinarity</h2>
      <p>
        I am Ahmed Elnour, an Interdisciplinary Studies Major, with a
        concentration in Math and Economics.My major allowed me to design a
        personalized degree which fit my future aspirations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming into college I wanted to major in Computer Science. I thought
        Computer Science would allow me to reach my goal of building my own
        startup one day. I realized that this was an unrealistic goal
        considering the millions of people I would be competing against.
        However, I also realized I could also become successful by joining a
        startup.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many areas within a startup where one could thrive besides
        coding. These areas include operations, marketing, product, and finance.
        So I started to identify skills which would put me on a trajectory to
        thrive within one of these areas. Ultimately, I figured economics and
        math would get the job done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Math is the foundation of all our sciences. The discipline covers a
        plethora of topics. The branches relevant to business are calculus and
        statistics. Calculus is the study of finding the rate at which different
        functions change. Statistics is the study of collecting and analyzing
        data. Finding the rate of change, and collecting and analyzing data, are
        some of the job requirements of an Economist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Economics is the study of how scarce resources are allocated, and how
        individuals make decisions based on scarce resources. An economist
        performs these studies by performing marginal analysis. This analysis
        compares the benefits of taking an action with the costs associated with
        taking the action. A business leader must perform the same analysis in
        order to become successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind the scenes, a successful business performs lots of calculations
        and analyses. The business must make decisions about how to allocate
        scarce resources like time, labor, money, and factors of production.
        Business leaders and key personnel must have a solid understanding of
        math and economics to perform these tasks well.
      </p>
      <p>
        An interdisciplinary degree combining math and economics provided me the
        best opportunity to learn these vital business skills. Integrating these
        disciplines will allow me to understand complex problems from the
        viewpoints of these lens. In addition, my interdisciplinary studies
        instilled me with values of empathy, humility, and ethical conscious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Empathy is the ability to deeply understand the thoughts, feelings, and
        worldview of other humans. Humility is the ability to honestly define
        and assess your own skills and abilities. Ethical conscious is the
        awareness of the effects of your actions. I will always strive to
        practice these values professionally and personally.
